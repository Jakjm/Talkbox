# Talkbox
EECS 2311 Project 

Members: Alberto Mastrofrancesco, Jordan Malek, and Rohan Talkad

## About

**Talkbox** is a highly customizable virtual lexigram interface that allows persons with speech disabilities to communicate. This project has two runnable applications: the **Talkbox Configurator** and the **Talkbox Simulator**. 
The Talkbox Configurator allows the user to add sounds to buttons and customize their individual appearances. It also supports recording if a microphone is available. The Talkbox Simulator then loads this
configuration and provides a touch interface to play back those sounds. 

## Instructions

Refer to the `UserManual.pdf` document in the `Documentation` folder. This contains detailed instructions on how to install, initialize, and customize the Talkbox application.
